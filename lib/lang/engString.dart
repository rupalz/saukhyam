  List<String> cont = ["We chose the name Saukhyam for our reusable pads because we believe menstruation has been undervalued and ignored for too long. Women give birth to every human being and menstruation makes that cycle possible. When you switch to our beautiful reusable pads, you are celebrating the life cycle and honoring your place in it.\n\nSaukhyam Reusable Pads were honored with the Most Innovative Product Award (2016) by the National Institute of Rural Development, India.\n\nThe project was lauded at UN Climate Change Conference (2018) in Poland for its sustainable financing mechanism.\n\nIn 2020, the Saukhyam team was recognized as the Social Enterprise of the Year for its \"exceptional impact, clarity and growth of work dedicated to furthering the UN Sustainable Development Goals\" from the Women for India and Social Founder Network coalition.",
  "Saukhyam Reusable Pads is a project of the Mata Amritanandamayi Math. The Math is an NGO with consultative status to the UN's ECOSOC. It is led by Amma, Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Devi, revered worldwide as a spiritual and humanitarian leader. When the Math adopted remote village clusters in 20 states of India in 2013, with the goal to transform them into role models of sustainable development, the foundation was laid for the pads project.",
  "The National Family Health Survey (2015-16) of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare revealed that only 48.2% girls in the age group of 15-24 years used hygienic methods of protection during menstrual periods in rural India as compared to 77.5% in urban India. Further, an overwhelming number of health problems faced by women in rural areas were traced back to one single factor - the absence of proper menstrual hygiene.\n\nToday Saukhyam Reusable Pads are used by thousands of women and girls not only in rural areas but also towns and cities of India and worldwide. Perhaps what appeals to rural women is the low price and easy availability of these pads. Women self help groups in several states of India produce and market Saukhyam Reusable Pads. In urban India, the educated informed woman is making a switch because these pads are better for the environment and for our health.",
  "It is not widely known but it is true. Just like trees are cut to make paper, trees are also cut to make the absorbent material in 99% of disposable pads made and sold globally.\n\nBanana fiber is an excellent absorbent. It is also a type of cellulose fiber. However, it is obtained from agricultural waste; no trees are cut to extract the fiber. India is the largest producer of bananas in the entire world. This fruit tree has a unique property - it fruits only once. After the fruit is obtained in 8-9 months, the tree is cut for it will never bear fruit again.\n\n\"Even though banana fiber comes from waste, one must understand that it is too precious to be used just once and thrown away\",Amma said.",
  "Saukhyam pads are a good solution because they are better for women's health and don't contain harmful chemicals like disposable sanitary pads do. Saukhyam pads are cost effective as well, as you only need to purchase them once and then you are set for your entire cycle.\n\nEvery year, an average woman will typically spend about two thousand rupees for buying disposable pads. Saukhyam Reusable Pad sets that half or even one-fourth of this amount last for 4-5 years and help one realize considerable cost savings. The cumulative savings, if switching to reusable pads, would be in excess of half a lakh of rupees when calculated over the entire menstruating lifetime."];

1. Soak soiled cloth pads in cold water for about 5 minutes; do not use hot water as that will set stains.  
   
2. Squeeze soaked cloth sanitary napkin gently and flush the water into the toilet.  
  
3. If hand washing, apply some washing soap, and rub gently. Rinse with cold water.  
  
4. Washable in a machine : cold wash pads along with other clothes.  
  
5. Sun dry your washable cloth pads by hanging them on a clothesline. It is perfectly fine to dry in the dryer; recommended settings are high heat for insert and low heat for the base piece for the Select line and high heat for the Essential line.

  **Tips**

1.  Best to wash your cloth pads right after use whenever possible. This is often not the case, but the latest should be the next day for best hygienic conditions.
2.  If you own enough cloth pads to go through the entire cycle without having to wash and prefer to wash all soiled washable cloth pads all together at the end of the cycle, then we recommend that you at least soak them shortly after use and air dry them for laundry in a machine later.

*I use disposable pads. These are made by multi-national companies who sell trusted brands.*


**However there are facts that I didn’t know. I am finding out about them now, and they are most inconvenient.**

* Every disposable pad has the equivalent of 4 plastic bags in it. I never could have imagined that there was so much plastic in just one pad.
* Over my entire menstruating lifetime, I will use and discard 10,000-15,000 pads or the equivalent of 40,000-60,000 plastic bags. 
* This plastic will continue to contaminate the environment for hundreds of years to come. If I burn the used pads (in an incinerator or in the open), that will release harmful furans and dioxins. 
* Dioxins are not just released when pads are burnt, they are also present in trace amounts on all pads, as a result of the bleaching process the pads go through.
* Dioxins are endocrine disruptors, and can harm me in many different ways.
* The skin in the vaginal area is highly permeable and anything that is in constant touch with the skin there will end up in my bloodstream
* If I continue using disposable pads, I will spend approximately ₹ 2,000 rupees every year, and perhaps close to ₹ 75,000 over my lifetime on a product that is not good for my health, neither good for our planet.
