1.  Soak soiled cloth pads in cold water for about 5 minutes; do not use hot water as that will set stains
2.  Squeeze soaked cloth sanitary napkin gently and flush the water into the toilet
3.  If hand washing, apply some washing soap, and rub gently. Rinse with cold water.
4.  Washable in a machine : cold wash pads along with other clothes
5.  Sun dry your washable cloth pads by hanging them on a clothesline. It is perfectly fine to dry in the dryer; recommended settings are high heat for insert and low heat for the base piece for the Select line and high heat for the Essential line.



**Tips**

1.  Best to wash your cloth pads right after use whenever possible. This is often not the case, but the latest should be the next day for best hygienic conditions.
2.  If you own enough cloth pads to go through the entire cycle without having to wash and prefer to wash all soiled washable cloth pads all together at the end of the cycle, then we recommend that you at least soak them shortly after use and air dry them for laundry in a machine later.

*I use disposable pads. These are made by multi-national companies who sell trusted brands.*


**However there are facts that I didn’t know. I am finding out about them now, and they are most inconvenient.**

* Every disposable pad has the equivalent of 4 plastic bags in it. I never could have imagined that there was so much plastic in just one pad.
* Over my entire menstruating lifetime, I will use and discard 10,000-15,000 pads or the equivalent of 40,000-60,000 plastic bags. 
* This plastic will continue to contaminate the environment for hundreds of years to come. If I burn the used pads (in an incinerator or in the open), that will release harmful furans and dioxins. 
* Dioxins are not just released when pads are burnt, they are also present in trace amounts on all pads, as a result of the bleaching process the pads go through.
* Dioxins are endocrine disruptors, and can harm me in many different ways.
* The skin in the vaginal area is highly permeable and anything that is in constant touch with the skin there will end up in my bloodstream
* If I continue using disposable pads, I will spend approximately ₹ 2,000 rupees every year, and perhaps close to ₹ 75,000 over my lifetime on a product that is not good for my health, neither good for our planet.
