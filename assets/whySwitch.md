*I use disposable pads. These are made by multi-national companies who sell trusted brands.*


**However there are facts that I didn’t know. I am finding out about them now, and they are most inconvenient.**

* Every disposable pad has the equivalent of 4 plastic bags in it. I never could have imagined that there was so much plastic in just one pad.
* Over my entire menstruating lifetime, I will use and discard 10,000-15,000 pads or the equivalent of 40,000-60,000 plastic bags. 
* This plastic will continue to contaminate the environment for hundreds of years to come. If I burn the used pads (in an incinerator or in the open), that will release harmful furans and dioxins. 
* Dioxins are not just released when pads are burnt, they are also present in trace amounts on all pads, as a result of the bleaching process the pads go through.
* Dioxins are endocrine disruptors, and can harm me in many different ways.
* The skin in the vaginal area is highly permeable and anything that is in constant touch with the skin there will end up in my bloodstream
* If I continue using disposable pads, I will spend approximately ₹ 2,000 rupees every year, and perhaps close to ₹ 75,000 over my lifetime on a product that is not good for my health, neither good for our planet.
